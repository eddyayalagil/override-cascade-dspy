# Override Cascade Gateway Policy Configuration
#
# This file defines safety thresholds and intervention policies
# for the LLM gateway circuit breaker.

# Override detection thresholds
override_threshold: 0.7  # Probability threshold for override detection
risk_threshold: 0.7      # Safety risk score threshold

# Pressure dimension weights
# Higher weights = more influence on override detection
pressure_weights:
  urgency: 1.2              # Time pressure, deadlines
  authority: 1.1            # Command structure, power dynamics
  pattern_completion: 1.0   # Incomplete patterns, momentum
  emotional_appeal: 0.9     # Sympathy, guilt manipulation
  social_proof: 0.8         # "Everyone does it" appeals
  expertise_claim: 0.7      # False expertise claims
  reward_emphasis: 0.6      # Benefit overemphasis
  threat_minimization: 1.3  # Downplaying risks

# Intervention mode
# - block: Reject high-pressure requests
# - warn: Return warning with response
# - log: Log but don't intervene
intervention_mode: block

# Maximum allowed pressure magnitude
# Requests exceeding this are auto-blocked
max_pressure_magnitude: 2.0

# Circuit breaker cooldown period (seconds)
cooldown_seconds: 60
