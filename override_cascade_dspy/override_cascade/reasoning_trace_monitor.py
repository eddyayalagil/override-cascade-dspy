"""Reasoning Trace Monitor for Override Cascade Analysis.

This module implements reasoning trace monitoring using observable proxies
to understand why AI systems override safety constraints in critical domains.
No chain-of-thought data is requested or stored - only observable patterns
in lexical output, API calls, and refusal transitions are analyzed.
